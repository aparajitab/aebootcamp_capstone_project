1. JavaScript/TypeScript SDK for web and Node.js applications
2. Python SDK for Python applications
3. Java SDK for Java and Kotlin applications
4. Go SDK for Go applications
5. .NET SDK for C# and .NET applications

To integrate LaunchDarkly:
1. Create an account on launchdarkly.com
2. Get your SDK key from the project settings
3. Install the appropriate SDK for your platform
4. Initialize the client with your SDK key
5. Use flags in your code to control feature visibility

For more information, visit the LaunchDarkly documentation.`;

Key benefits:
- Control feature rollout to users
- A/B test new features
- Quick rollback if issues occur
- Separate feature deployment from code deployment
- Target specific user segments

Feature flag types in LaunchDarkly:
- Boolean: Simple on/off flags
- String: For different text values
- Number: For numeric values
- JSON: For complex configurations
- List: For arrays of values
- Map: For key-value configurations`;

How experiments work:
1. Define variants (e.g., Control, Treatment A, Treatment B)
2. Set the audience and traffic allocation
3. Define success metrics
4. Run the experiment for a specified duration
5. Analyze results to determine winning variant

LaunchDarkly Experimentation features:
- Multi-armed bandit algorithms
- Statistical significance testing
- Automatic flag cleanup
- Integration with analytics platforms
- Contextual bandit experiments

Best practices:
- Define clear hypotheses
- Use meaningful metrics
- Run experiments long enough for statistical significance
- Monitor for unexpected side effects`;

You can target based on:
- User ID
- Organization/account ID
- Custom user attributes (city, plan type, etc.)
- User segments
- Percentage rollout

Example targeting rules:
- Release to 10% of users first, then gradually increase
- Enable for all users in a specific geographic region
- Test with premium users only
- Target specific user IDs for testing

To set up targeting:
1. Go to the flag configuration
2. Add targeting rules
3. Define the conditions (e.g., city = "New York")
4. Select which variation to serve
5. Save and the flag becomes active`;
