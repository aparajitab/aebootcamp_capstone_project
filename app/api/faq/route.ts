    return `A feature flag is a software development technique that allows you to toggle specific features on and off in production without deploying new code.

Key characteristics:
- Decouples deployment from feature release
- Enables gradual rollout to users
- Allows quick rollback if issues occur
- Facilitates A/B testing and experimentation
- Reduces risk of new features

Common use cases:
1. Gradual rollout: Release to 5% → 25% → 50% → 100% of users
2. A/B testing: Compare old vs new feature with metrics
3. Kill switch: Disable problematic features without code changes
4. User targeting: Enable only for premium users or specific regions
5. Testing: Features available only to team members`;
  }

  if (lowerQuestion.includes("what is") && lowerQuestion.includes("experiment")) {
    return `An experiment (also called A/B test) is a controlled test where you compare two or more variations to determine which performs better.

How experiments work:
1. Create variations (Control, Variant A, Variant B)
2. Define your hypothesis
3. Set target audience and traffic allocation
4. Define success metrics (conversion rate, engagement, etc.)
5. Run for statistically significant duration
6. Analyze results and declare winner

LaunchDarkly experimentation includes:
- Automatic winner detection
- Multi-armed bandit optimization
- Statistical significance testing
- Contextual bandit experiments
- Metric tracking and analysis

Benefits:
- Data-driven decisions
- Reduced risk of rolling out poor features
- Learn user preferences
- Continuous optimization`;

Feature Flags:
- Control feature visibility
- Can be permanent or temporary
- Used for gradual rollout
- Enables/disables functionality
- Manages risk of new features
- Can stay in code indefinitely

Experiments:
- Measure impact of changes
- Always temporary
- Compare variations statistically
- Tracks success metrics
- Validates hypotheses
- Should be cleaned up after completion

Usage:
- Use flags for deployment control
- Use experiments for hypothesis validation
- Often use both together: flag to control visibility + experiment to measure impact`;

  if (lowerQuestion.includes("long-standing") || lowerQuestion.includes("long standing")) {

Implications:
- May indicate technical debt
- Could be permanent feature that should be hard-coded
- Could be outdated and no longer needed
- Increases codebase complexity

Best practices for long-standing flags:
1. Review regularly and determine necessity
2. If feature is stable, hard-code it or remove the flag
3. If flag is no longer needed, clean it up
4. Document why flag should remain if needed
5. Assign a maintainer to track it

LaunchDarkly helps by:
- Identifying long-standing flags
- Alerting flag maintainers
- Providing cleanup recommendations
- Generating reports on flag health`;

  if (lowerQuestion.includes("expiring") || lowerQuestion.includes("expiration")) {
    return `Expiring soon flags are feature flags or experiments with expiration dates within the next 7 days.

When flags expire:
- They are marked for review or cleanup
- May be automatically disabled or archived
- Could leave code in broken state
- Should be reviewed before expiration

Why use expiration dates:
- Forces flag review and cleanup
- Prevents flag accumulation
- Ensures temporary flags don't persist
- Documents flag lifecycle

Best practices:
1. Set expiration dates on temporary flags
2. Review flags before expiration
3. Decide: hard-code, remove, or extend
4. Test thoroughly if extending expiration
5. Update maintainer and document decisions
6. Monitor expiring flags dashboard

LaunchDarkly alerts:
- Notify maintainer when expiring
- Provide cleanup recommendations
- Generate expiration reports`;

  if (lowerQuestion.includes("flag type")) {
    return `LaunchDarkly Feature Flag Types:

1. Boolean Flags
   - Simple true/false values
   - Most common type
   - Use for on/off features
   - Example: isDarkModeEnabled

2. String Flags
   - Return text values
   - Configure different text values per variation
   - Example: buttonColor = "blue" or "green"

3. Number Flags
   - Return numeric values
   - Configure numbers per variation
   - Example: maxRetries = 3 or 5

4. JSON Flags
   - Return complex JSON objects
   - Configure detailed variations
   - Example: { "colorScheme": "dark", "fontSize": 14 }

5. List Flags
   - Return arrays of values
   - Useful for multi-value configurations
   - Example: ["feature1", "feature2", "feature3"]

6. Map Flags
   - Return key-value pairs
   - Store related configuration
   - Example: { "primary": "#001f3f", "secondary": "#4CAF50" }

Choosing flag types:
- Use Boolean for simple on/off
- Use String/Number for different values per variation
- Use JSON for complex configurations
- Use List/Map for multiple related values`;
